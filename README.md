# arxiv-classification
## Introduction
The arXiv houses academic papers in a range of subjects, including math and physics. The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine how well the title and/or abstract of an academic paper from the arXiv acts as an indicator for which academic subject the paper addresses.  
## Source
The dataset used for this project came from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv) of metadata for 1.7M+ papers on the arxiv.
